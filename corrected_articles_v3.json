Cyclopentolate and atropine can also be useful. Recently, there are also cataracts drops under trial, which can dissolve cataracts.       Surgery: If visual acuity is worse than 6/24 or there is a medical indication (phacolytic glaucoma, phacomorphic glaucoma, retinal detachment) in which a cataract is adversely affecting the health of the eye, surgery is always needed.       Congenital Cataract: No treatment is necessary if visual acuity is more than 6/24, and a patient can carry out their normal routine activities. Refractive glasses can be advised for the blurring of vision or diplopia. If visual acuity falls below 6/24, surgery is needed, and the surgeon can opt for one of the following surgical procedures depending upon patients' complaints and severity of the disease.[6]       Irrigation and aspiration of the lens       Irrigation and aspiration of the lens with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation       Irrigation aspiration of the lens with IOL, anterior vitrectomy and primary posterior capsulotomy       Senile Cataract: Treatment options are the following[7][8]:       Medical: No medical treatment is effective once the cataract has become mature.
